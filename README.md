## Lumiform

The Lumiform target was created as a macOS target for faster TDD. While developing a macOS target, you can choose your own Mac as the build target, hence there's no need to build and launch a simulator. The target is made to support `iphoneos` and `iphonesimulator` platforms and so they can be linked to iOS projects with no problem.
